              "'We are an omnichannel retailer that makes it easy for our customers to feel at home. We sell a wide assortment of merchandise in the Home, Baby, Beauty & Wellness markets and operate under the names Bed Bath & Beyond (\"BBB\"), buybuy BABY (\"BABY\"), and Harmon, Harmon Face Values, or Face Values (collectively, \"Harmon\"). We also operate Decorist, an online interior design platform that provides personalized home design services. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture, which operates retail stores in Mexico under the name Bed Bath & Beyond. For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we accounted for our operations as two operating segments: North American Retail and Institutional Sales, the latter of which did not meet the quantitative thresholds under GAAP and, therefore, was not a reportable segment. The Institutional Sales operating segment was comprised of Linen Holdings, which was divested in October 2020. We will continue to account for our operations as one North American Retail reporting segment going forward. We have undertaken significant changes over the past year, including extensive changes to executive leadership, as well as development of essential strategies and plans to focus on positioning our business for long-term success. During the past year, as the world responded to the unparalleled challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken aggressive and thoughtful steps to safeguard our people and communities while we continue to serve our customers. Similar to many other businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst to accelerate the pace of change and innovation across our Company, advancing ongoing efforts to reset our cost structure and build a modern, durable model for long-term profitable growth. We are driving a digital-first, omni-always growth strategy and optimizing our digital and physical store channels to provide our customers with a seamless omni-channel shopping experience. Digital purchases, including web and mobile, can be shipped to a customer from our distribution facilities, directly from vendors, or from a store. Store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store\\'s inventory or may also be shipped to a customer from one of our distribution facilities, from a vendor, or from another store. Customers can also choose to pick up orders using our newly introduced Buy Online Pickup In Store (\"BOPIS\") and contactless Curbside Pickup services, as well as return online purchases to a store. Customers can also make purchases through one of our customer contact centers '"
